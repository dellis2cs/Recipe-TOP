    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by creaming the butter and sugar together until light an fluffy</li>
        <li>Add the egg and the vanilla extract, then beat just until combined. You don’t want to overmix the egg, or your cookies may come out tough!</li><br>
        <li>Now, turn out the dough to your work surface and push it together a few times to let it come together. You do not want to knead the dough or work it much, but you’ll want it to come together into a smooth dough you can roll out.</li><br>
        <li>Roll out the dough to ¼ inch thickness. I recommend you work in batches here to make the rolling more manageable. Cut out your cookies and transfer them to lined baking sheets.</li><br>
        <li>Bake the cookies, one tray at a time, until lightly golden. Cool them on the pan for 5 minutes, then remove to a cooling rack to cool completely before decorating!</li><br>
    </ol>
